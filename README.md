# Shopping Cart

In this project, I will be creating a mock shopping cart. The application will have two pages (home and shop) that users can add products to their cart.

I will be implementing this with ReactJS. This is a project from The Odin Project. I'm looking forward to applying what I have learned so far. I will be practicing using tools like routers and testing frameworks.
